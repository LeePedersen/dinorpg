    <h3>Escape from Dino Island!</h3>
    <p>OH NO! While flying to the Bahamas for a much needed vacation, your aircraft's port engine blows up, and the plane crashes! You're the only survivor. But are you going to give up? Of course not! You're going to make it off of this mysterious island, and earn a well-needed vacation. However, there is some creepy prehistoric noises off in the distance. The choices you make are up to you.</p>

    <div id="scenario1">
      <p>While rummaging through the fuselage, you find a <span class="equipment1"></span>, a <span class="equipment2"></span>, and a giant <span class="equipment3"></span>. You are ready to explore the island. Fate is not on your side today, for as soon as you step outside of the aircraft, a rather angry looking <span class="dinosaur1"></span> jumps you. How do you respond?</p>

          <input type="radio" id="s1a1" name="" value=""> "I will use my <span class="equipment1"></span> to attempt to slay this funky dude!"

    <div id="scenario2">
      <br>
      <p>You've been exploring the island for several days, and are desperate for food and other supplies. You spot a mysterious cave in the distance, and feel strangely motivated to explore it. The cave is big and dark, and you're scared. But as much as you are scared, you are also brave. You enter the cave. OH NO! You have stumbled *literally* upon a sleeping <span class="dinosaur2"></span>. The waking beast was expecting a mate, and you are a poor substitute. How do you escape this terrifying and slightly awkward situation?</p>
      <form class="action2" action="index.html" method="post">
          <input type="radio" id="s2a1" name="" value=""> "I think I will throw my <span class="equipment1"></span> at it and turn around."

          <input type="radio" id="s2a3" name="" value="">"I try to camoflauge myself into the cave wall hiding behind my <span class="equipment3"></span> which just happens to be the same color as the cave wall."

    <div id="scenario3">
      <br>
      <p>You have built an impressive, lavish raft from the materials found in the cave. While concerned about how you will get to the Bahamas, your concern is replaced with a strange smell. You try to discern the cause of the smell, and it turns out that a giant, stench-ridden, aquatic <span class="dinosaur3"></span> has been lurking under your raft. It seems as if you made the raft a little too lavish. How do you earn your vacation?</p>
      <form class="action3" action="index.html" method="post">
          <input type="radio" id="s3a1" name="" value=""> "I will throw my <span class="equipment4"></span> away from my raft to try and distract the menace from below!"

          <input type="radio" id="s3a2" name="" value="">"I will brace my <span class="equipment5"></span> on the <span class="dinosaur3"></span>'s nose, ensuring that I always stay some distance in front of him, hoping to be pushed quite quickly all the way to the Bahamas."
          <br>
          <input type="radio" id="s3a3" name="" value="">"I wait until the <span class="dinosaur6"></span> has enveloped my raft in it's epic maw, and then throw my <span class="equipment3"></span> into it's throat, in an attempt to kill it."

      <div id="scenario1lucky">
        <p>Using special tactics and sound logic, you successfully drive off the <span class="dinosaur1"></span>! It is a harsh, restless few nights within the plane's broken fuselage. Hope is a diminishing commodity.</p>

      <div id="scenario1unlucky">
        <p>Despite your best efforts, the <span class="dinosaur1"></span> breaks through your defenses, destroys all of your items, and eats you alive! Your last thoughts are of the vacation that you will never have.</p>

      </div>
      <div id="scenario2lucky">
        <p>You're able to defeat the mighty <span class="dinosaur2"></span>! It seems the dinosuar was protecting some useful items. To the victor go the spoils! You manage to plunder a <span class="equipment4"></span>, a luxurious <span class="equipment5"></span>, and a <span class="equipment6"></span>. In addition are some building materials, and a new dose of determination to flee this wretched island!</p>
        <button type="submit" name="button" id="continue2">Wow! continue your journey...</button>
      </div>
      <div id="scenario2unlucky">
        <p>Foolish adventurer, the <span class="dinosaur2"></span> sees right through your feeble attempts at survival and subjects you to a slow and painful death. Your items are added to the dinosaur's plunder.</p>

      <div id="scenario3lucky">
        <p>Absolutely remarkable! Your unorthodox tactic has turned the tide (literally) against the <span class="dinosaur3"></span>! You have escaped the island, and are well on your way to a nice vacation in the Bahamas. It matters not, the fact that you have no idea where you are or what direction to take, for you have beaten the odds and made it out alive!</p>
      </div>
      <div id="scenario3unlucky">
        <p>You were so close! Yet in the end, so so far. The <span class="dinosaur3"></span> easily smashes your pathetic raft, and chomps you to pieces.</p>

    <p>TOO SLOW! Your lack of action has prevented all hope of escape, and you are now being digested within the guts of a super-lizard!</p>
